Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Term
ecosystem-

Node.js- a platform built on Chrome's Javascript runtime with the purpose of building scalable network apps(also build them fast).

V8 Engine-Google's open source Javascript and WebAssembly engine. It uses C++. It's used in Chrome and Node.js. It translates JavaScript into effecient machinge code instead of using a tranditional interpreter, it uses a complier instead.

module- same as package. The terms are used interchangably. But I believe it is just one file of a package. Also described as one script. 

package-bits of re-usable. A directory with one of files in it. (package.json which has meta-data)

node package manager (npm)- makes it easy for Javascript devs to share code that solves problems. Can refer to the website, directory/CLI or the client/registry.

server-computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or services in a network. They are usualy dedicated to only servers tasks.

environment-

interpreter-

compiler- a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming lagnuage (the original sorce language) into another language(the target language). Typicaly meant that it will translate high level programming code to lower level language for the purpose of execution.
